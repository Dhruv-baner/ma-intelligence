    "# 📋 Notebook 2: News Intelligence - Complete Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What This Notebook Is For\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this notebook as **building an intelligent newspaper reader** that works 24/7. While Notebook 1 set up our kitchen, this notebook creates a smart assistant that reads hundreds of business articles every day and tells us which ones are about mergers and acquisitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In simple terms:** We're creating a system that automatically collects business news, finds articles about companies buying or selling each other, analyzes whether the news is positive or negative, and creates daily briefings that summarize all the M&A activity happening in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world value:** Investment bankers pay teams of analysts to read news all day looking for M&A opportunities. Our AI system does this automatically and never misses a story.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ Why We Need News Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're trying to stay updated on everything happening in your neighborhood. You could:\n",
    "- **Read every local newspaper** (time-consuming and you might miss some)\n",
    "- **Ask friends to tell you news** (unreliable and incomplete)\n",
    "- **Set up Google alerts** (helpful but still requires manual reading)\n",
    "- **Build an AI assistant** that reads everything and summarizes only what matters ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for M&A intelligence, there are thousands of business articles published daily across hundreds of news sources. Our AI system will:\n",
    "- **Automatically collect** articles from major business news sources\n",
    "- **Filter for relevance** - only flag articles containing M&A keywords\n",
    "- **Analyze sentiment** - determine if the news is positive, negative, or neutral\n",
    "- **Link to companies** - connect news stories to companies in our database\n",
    "- **Generate daily briefings** - create executive summaries of all M&A activity\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Technical Foundation (Simplified)\n",
    "\n",
    "We're building four main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📰 **Automated News Collection**\n",
    "- **What it is:** Like having a robot that visits every major business news website daily and downloads new articles\n",
    "- **Why we need it:** M&A deals are first announced in business news, so we need to catch them immediately\n",
    "- **How it works:** RSS feeds and web scraping to automatically download articles from Reuters, MarketWatch, Yahoo Finance, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **AI Text Analysis**\n",
    "- **What it is:** Teaching our computer to \"read\" and understand news articles like a human would\n",
    "- **Why we need it:** We need to automatically identify which articles are about M&A and determine if they're positive or negative news\n",
    "- **How it works:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect M&A keywords and sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗄️ **News Database System**\n",
    "- **What it is:** A organized storage system for all the articles we collect, linked to our company database\n",
    "- **Why we need it:** We need to store, search, and analyze thousands of articles over time\n",
    "- **How it works:** SQLite tables that link news articles to specific companies and track sentiment over time\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📋 **Daily Briefing Generator**\n",
    "- **What it is:** An AI system that reads all the day's M&A news and writes executive-style summaries\n",
    "- **Why we need it:** Busy executives want summaries, not hundreds of individual articles\n",
    "- **How it works:** Automated report generation that ranks stories by importance and creates readable summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Step-by-Step Breakdown\n",
    "\n",

    "**Output:** Raw article data with headlines, publication dates, and content\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Cell 4: M&A Article Filtering** 🔍\n",
    "**What we're doing:** Using AI to identify which articles are actually about mergers and acquisitions\n",

    "**M&A keywords:** \"merger\", \"acquisition\", \"buyout\", \"takeover\", \"strategic review\", \"divest\"\n",
    "**Output:** Filtered list of only M&A-relevant articles\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Cell 5: Sentiment Analysis** 💭\n",
    "**What we're doing:** Using AI to determine if each M&A article contains positive, negative, or neutral news\n",
    "**Simple analogy:** Like having someone read each article and tell you if it's good news or bad news\n",
    "**AI technique:** VADER sentiment analysis specifically designed for news and social media\n",
    "**Output:** Sentiment scores (-1 to +1) for each article\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Cell 6: Company Linking** 🔗\n",
    "**What we're doing:** Connecting each news article to specific companies in our database\n",
    "**Simple analogy:** Like sorting newspaper clippings into folders for each person/company mentioned\n",
    "**Matching process:** Search article text for company names and stock tickers from our database\n",
    "**Output:** Articles tagged with relevant company IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Cell 7: Daily Briefing Generation** 📋\n",
    "**What we're doing:** Creating automated daily summaries of all M&A news\n",
    "**Simple analogy:** Like having a personal assistant read all the news and give you a 5-minute briefing\n",
    "**Report contents:** Top stories, market trends, company highlights, sentiment analysis\n",
    "**Output:** Professional executive briefing ready for email or dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Cell 8: Historical Analysis** 📈\n",
    "**What we're doing:** Analyzing patterns in news coverage to identify trends and cycles\n",
    "**Simple analogy:** Like looking at months of weather reports to predict seasonal patterns\n",
    "**Analysis types:** Volume trends, sentiment patterns, sector activity, deal timing\n",
    "**Output:** Insights about M&A market cycles and news patterns\n",

    "\n",
    "**Think of it like this:**\n",
    "- **Notebook 1:** Built our research library (company data)\n",
    "- **Notebook 2:** Hired a smart newspaper reader (news intelligence) ← We are here\n",
    "- **Notebook 3:** Will hire document analysts (SEC filing analysis)\n",
    "- **Notebook 4:** Will build the prediction engine (AI models that combine everything)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💼 Business Value\n",
    "\n",
    "**This news intelligence system alone is valuable because:**\n",
